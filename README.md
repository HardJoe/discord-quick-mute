<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Discord Quick Mute is a Google Chrome extension designed for Discord Web users. This extension simplifies the process of muting or deafening yourself in voice chat without the need to switch between browser tabs. With Discord Quick Mute installed, users can access a convenient and easily accessible button or hotkey that allows them to instantly mute or deafen their microphone without going to an active Discord tab. Users can also access a popup containing mute and deafen buttons.

This feature is especially useful during online meetings, gaming sessions, or any scenario where quick and hassle-free voice chat control is essential. It enhances the user experience on Discord Web by providing a more efficient way to manage voice settings, ultimately contributing to a smoother communication experience for users.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

There are two ways to use this extension:

1. Using keyboard shortcuts.
The default shortcuts are:
    - `Ctrl + Shift + K` for Mute
    - `Ctrl + Shift + L` for Deafen  

    You can change them in `chrome://extensions` > Keyboard shortcuts >   Discord Quick Mute
2. Using extension popup. Click the extension icon on the address bar or list of extension and click one of the buttons to mute or deafen

The extension icon will show you one of the three states:
- A microphone means you're neither muted nor deafened
- A crossed microphone means you're muted, but not deafened
- A crossed headphone means you're muted and deafened
